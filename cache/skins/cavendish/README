When you installed the Theme you have to create a file with options. There is already a example options.css given with the Skin as it is used in the Web Community Wiki

For the Logo
#header h6 a {
	/* change this to the URL of your Logo */
    background: transparent url("../../images/e/e0/Logo_Gross.png") no-repeat;
	width: 340px;
    height: 44px;
}

When you would like to have a fixed width
#container {
	width: 1024px;
}
